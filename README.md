Product Flavor
=======
Last project release introduce the new flavorDimension "user" with two values:
- kids
- adult

This dimension main idea is to target who is gonna use the built apk. Is it a child or
an adult?

The "adult" productFlavor is the historic app with previous user
experience whereas the "kids" productFlavor introduce some changes in order to
allow kids to use the app despite the lack of reading skills.

This better experience for kids was initiated by [jo-elimuai](https://github.com/jo-elimuai)
who validated each improvements from an UX point of view thanks to his precious
knowledges of digital contents for young children.
